  **Important For You**

  `This repo is in Constant Development and Updates`

  `Future changes will be applied both to Appearance and Sources List and to further /Automate the Hacking`  
  
  ## Script developed and writted on python 3.
  
  
  # Usage \from any shell, terminal, console || Both linux and also Windows/WSL||
  
  * Make sure you have python 3 installed --v ---version
  
 ```
  python3 latestCyberNews.py
 ```
  
# Main Concept 
  
* To be able to run a script from anywhere on Linux, it is recommended that you move it to one of the paths found in the `$PATH` environment variable.

* The `$PATH` environment variable contains a list of paths that the system will search for executables when a command is typed in the terminal. So if you put your script in one of the paths listed in `$PATH`, you can run it from anywhere.

**The most common paths found in $PATH are:**
```
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
```
  
* To move the script to one of these paths, you can use the command `sudo mv` followed by the source path of the script and the destination path. For example, if your script is in the `/home/user/my_script.sh` directory and you want to move it to `/usr/local/bin`, you can run the following command:

```
sudo mv /home/username/my_script.sh /usr/local/bin/
```
* Once you've moved the script to one of the paths in $PATH, make sure to give it execute permissions with the following command:

```
sudo chmod +x /path/to/script.sh
```
* This way, you can run the script from anywhere on the system with the command:

```
my_script.sh
```

```
sudo my_script.sh
```
  
* depending on the permissions that the script needs to be executed.  
  
  
  
## Recommended [but not obligatory] **have `pip` installed**
  
  * Pip is the Python package manager used to install and manage third-party Python packages. On most Linux and Windows distributions, pip is not installed by default, so you will have to install it manually.
  
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 --version
```
#### Pip en Windows
  
* Download the get-pip.py file from the official pip website at the following link: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

* Open a command line window (CMD) as administrator. You can do this by searching for CMD in the Start menu, right clicking on the icon and selecting "Run as administrator".

* Navigate to the directory where the get-pip.py file is located using the cd command. For example, if the file is in the Downloads folder, you can use the following command:

```
cd C:\Users\YourUser\Downloads
```
  
Run the following command to install pip:

```
python get-pip.py
```

Verify that pip has been installed correctly by running the following command:
  
```
pip --version
```
  
Thats all.
  
## Mandatory, if you are a Developer! 

**If you gonna edit the sources list to add your own you need beautifulsoup library**

* To install Beautiful Soup in Python using pip, follow these steps:

* Open a command prompt or terminal window.

Type the following command to install Beautiful Soup using pip:

```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```


* Wait for the installation process to complete.

* Verify that Beautiful Soup is installed by opening a Python console and importing the library:

```
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```
* If the import statement completes successfully, Beautiful Soup is installed and ready to use.
  
## Proof of Work

  *The Main concept was 3 main\sources and then the script is scrapes on the others, looking for the latest news*
  
  * You can click on the news and it will open in your favorite browser, even on the sources and go manual for news.
